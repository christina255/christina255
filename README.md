christina255/christina255: is a loving Aries 
Zodiac Signe that what makes her
 so special itbletsnher gives her
 strength to overcome her fears and 
difficulties in life. Being a Aries
 is a very strong person to have as 
your friend or partner because they 
are loyal to whomever they choose to 
become friends with or romantic partner 
either way this is the most exciting 
Zodiac Sign that you can have on your 
side because of their loyalty and 
compassion to please others before 
they do anything for themselves so 
that being said she will always make 
sure your her #1 fan and she will make 
sure you know it too and will make sure 
your happy and not miserable or trying to 
play you once you got a Aries lock that 
down very fast cuz they are worth it but 
sometimes they can get in their own way and 
get jealous of other people who your 
paying more attention to because Aries
 love having all your undivided 
 attention so they know you still 
 care for them and so you might 
 need to always make sure your 
 letting them know how your truly 
 feeling about them and they will
 make sure you get the same in return. 
 They will always respect your decision 
 and needs and wants just as long as you 
do the same For them because too. It's only 
fair after all cuz it's never fun or
fair to make someone who loves you do all 
the hard work for you without having it in return, But Aries can be a little 
bit Hot headed at times if they don't get 
the results they are looking for from 
you so always show how you feel about 
them no matter what it'll pay
 off in the long run trust me!
 thats when you will be on their, 
 bad side witch 
 you don't want to see. 
  But besides that Aries 
 are, the most down right loyal and
 passionate people you will ever
 know and they are very emotional 
 about everything they do and you
 noticing that will drive her 
 wild and rock your world 😉
 and Aries are a fire Sign so they will 
 get heated very fast unless you show 
 them your sorry and spoil them.
 Because they will go over 
the top to always make sure 
your very spoiled by them 100%.
 Because they are People Pleaser's
